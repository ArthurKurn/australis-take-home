# 🎯 Your Task

Build a simple **Pokédex** where users can:

## 🔍 1. Search for Pokémon

Use the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

**Example endpoint:**
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu

Allow the user to type a name and fetch matching Pokémon info:

- Name
- Image (sprite)
- Types

## ⭐ 2. Save Favorite Pokémon

After viewing search results, the user should be able to **save** a Pokémon.

- Display saved Pokémon in a **Favorites** list.
- Use `localStorage` to persist favorites across page reloads.

## ❌ 3. Remove from Favorites

Allow users to **remove** Pokémon from their favorites list.

## 💡 Bonus (Optional)

If you have extra time, consider adding:

- A note field for each saved Pokémon.
- A clean and responsive layout.
- Prevention of duplicate Pokémon being saved.
- A loading spinner while fetching data.
- Error handling (e.g., "Pokémon not found" message).
